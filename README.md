## Information needed to create this project

1. Bulma Framework Use

```
Bulma is a free, open source CSS framework based on Flexbox and used by more than 100,000 developers.

Customisation ability is simply fantastic. Code divided into separate files across components boundaries, along with separate variables files allows us to customise almost every part of the app and achieve the result we want.

```

2. Javascript

Very often when you write code, you want to perform different actions for different conditions. 

```
    addEventListener.. for functionality of the nav burger menu
    
```
3. The PHP foreach Loop

The foreach loop works only on arrays, and is used to loop through each key/value pair in an array.

```
For every loop iteration, the value of the current array element is assigned to $value and the array 
pointer is moved by one, until it reaches the last array element.

```
